# Wordle Solver

It does what it says on the tin.  It also plays on hard mode.

If you're using it interactively--that is, without specifying the
`--answer` option, input the results you get as a five-character string,
where `.` means it's not in the word, `?` means it's in the word but in
the wrong place, and `!` means it's in the right place.

If you know the answer and want to see if this program will solve it
faster than you did, try `--answer` and see how many guesses it takes.
