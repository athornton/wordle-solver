# Static test files

These files are adapted from Peter Norvig's https://norvig.com/ngrams/ .

They are the `count_1w.txt` file split into the first 1000 five-letter
and first 800 six-letter words.

This is a large enough pool that the solver is doing something
interesting, but also small enough that it won't take long about it.
